Buku
====

`buku <https://github.com/jarun/buku>`_ is a powerful bookmark manager written in Python3 and SQLite3. When I started writing it, I couldn’t find a flexible cmdline solution with a private, portable, merge-able database along with browser integration. Hence, Buku (after my son’s nickname, meaning close to the heart in my language).
